# Benchmarking Rust Web Frameworks: hyper vs gotham vs actix-web vs warp vs rocket

I was building a very performance sensitive API service using Rust and I was trying to find out which http framework I should use
as there a lot of frameworks out there for Rust. So, I just shortlisted some of them and I ran a `hello world route` for every frameworks
and its result is very interesting.

## Benchmarking Tool

I used `wrk` to test those http servers:

```sh
$ wrk --latency -t4 -c200 -d8s http://127.0.0.1:8081
```

## Results

I ran all those tests on:

`Intel Core i7 CPU @ 3.20GHz Ã— 12, 16GB of RAM`

Before run, I created a release build:

```sh
$ cargo build --release
```

#### Caveat

In order to run a fair comparison a suitable environment variable should be set
while running, `ROCKET_ENV=prod ./rocket`.
Indeed, by default is set to `dev`, and it is spending a lot of time logging
everything on the console.

## Conclusion

`hyper` -> Perfect for an app which requires more controls on http and
performance. It provides `async` with `tokio.rs`.

`gotham` -> A high-level version of `hyper`.

`actix-web` -> Provides a very high-level API and injects some boilerplate code
as well as runtime. It provides `async` with `tokio.rs`.

`warp` -> A very high level version of `hyper` and easy to use and it requires
a few lines of codes to start a server. It provides `async` with `tokio.rs`.

`rocket` -> High level, actively developed and quite used. Nevertheless it has
not the same performances as the others.
